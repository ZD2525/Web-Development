                    <h5 class="mt-4">Introduction:</h5>
                    <p>The essential story being told by my site is all about promoting this Virtual Youtuber group called Virtual eSports Project (VSPO!). I followed one of the common types of structure for my web page, the hierarchical model.
                    <br>
                    The resolutions that I created for my website is a desktop size, and a tablet dimension (width: 768px), excluding this report.html
                    <br>
                    The website was created by myself, spending a lot of time watching youtube tutorials and experimenting with the code myself, by changing all the stuff to see what it does and how it changes the site objects. For example, the different ways to use bootstrap to create different rows and columns with varying sizes that are responsive, to reduce the amount of css required to style things. For example, in the class name of the html, we are able to use p-n, whereby p is the padding, and n is the number of padding we want to have. If we want to have just padding for the x-axis, we can just do px-n. The same for margins, it will be m-n.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">The 3 things that have inspired me when creating my website:</h5>
                    <p>
                    Firstly, the talents that are part of this group.
                    <br> 
                    Secondly, other virtual youtuber groups and other websites such as their own webpage.
                    <br>
                    Thirdly, another website that is for selling mechanical keyboard parts in Singapore, as I stay at home most of the time, browsing the web, and these streamers are the ones that kept me entertained at home. The mechanical keyboard is a hobby that I've picked up a few years ago before the pandemic started, and since then, I've been trying to promote mechanical keyboards to my friends as an investment to themselves especially if they are using a keyboard for most of their day.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5 class="mt-4">The 3 ways in which my site is accessible:</h5>
                    <p>
                    Firstly, all of my web page content can be accessed with a keyboard. As many assistive technologies rely on keyboard-only navigation, my site is accessible with a keyboard, using just the tab button, the user is able to access different pages and content.
                    <br>
                    Secondly, my images have alternative text to it. This is to help users understand what the image is placed there for, in cases when the image fails to load. This will give context to users who would otherwise miss the image.
                    <br>
                    Thirdly, there is appropriate padding on my site not only for good aesthetics, but aids in accessibility. Ensuring that there is enough padding between elements is a visual indication of breaks in content. Padding aids in content being better digested, especially by those with disabilities.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">The 3 ways in which I have considered usability in my site:</h5>
                    <p>
                    Firstly, my website is clear and usable. It appeals to the target audience who are just flipping through a magazine, and to see a Virtual Youtuber group with all these eye-catching elements. 
                    <br>
                    Secondly, my site is clean and easy to navigate. With a top navigational bar that contains the logo on the left, to always redirect us back to the home page, and having the navigation menu featuring the other categories in the site, which will be highlighted when the user is currently on the page, will let the user know which page they are currently on.
                    <br>
                    Thirdly, my site is relevant to users who are interested in VSPO!, or just any Virtual Youtubers. When people are interested in streamers, what they would want to know are any important news regarding them, and any videos related to them which will help them know more about their streamers.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">The 3 things I had to learn or find out by myself when creating my site:</h5>
                    <p>
                    One of the things I had to learn while creating my site is how to create an image carousel. I went to look at source codes of other websites first, and they use this library called swiper.js. As I am unfamiliar with this, I went to google on ways to create an image carousel, and I found this simpler library called Owl Carousel. I learned how to use it to create more 'interactive' elements in my site.
                    <br>
                    Another thing I had to learn while creating my site is how to use jQuery. As many tutorials on how to use certain stuff with javascript is via jQuery, I went to search more on how to write jQuery, and their syntax. I realised that jQuery is just a framework for JavaScript. It is a free open-source library and is fast and concise. The syntax is a little different from pure JavaScript, for e.g Instead of document.getElementByClassName("sticky-top"), I can just use $(.sticky-top).
                    <br>
                    The third thing that I had to learn while creating my site is combining different libraries together to create an aesthetically good looking site. For example, I used this wow.js and animate.css together, to create an animation of elements fading into the page after a short delay, with different timings.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">The aspect(s) of my work that I think worked well is:</h5>
                    <p>
                    The website being very clean, with elements that are pleasing to watch, and the pictures are very colorful. I have shown my site to some of my friends to get their feedback while I was creating this website and they also mentioned that it is a good website for the current knowledge that I have so far regarding web development.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">The aspect(s) of my work that I think could be improved is</h5>
                    <p>
                    I could have made the website more complete, by having actual htmls of the different news instead of just linking it straight to the original site news, or maybe having the footer have the quick links and contacts in the middle, and remove the carousel gallery. The problem with having actual htmls of the different news is that the original news are all in Japanese, and to translate them to English will take awhile, unless I use a translation application where I just copy and paste for the application to translate, but there will definitely be errors in grammar etc.
                    <br>
                    How I might do things differently next time is to use other libraries, as I've heard that many people use React.js and Angular.js to create their web pages. The only problem would be learning how to use these, as their syntax may be different from what I am used to using with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.
                    <br>
                    I would probably also create a different page with the streaming schedule of the talents, but I am currently unsure how I would do that, as most of the talents do not have a fixed streaming schedule.
                    </p>
